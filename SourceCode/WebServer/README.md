# FPT Librarian Module - API part

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

# Basic Design

- We expose REST API at web server side so that multiple client can consume our's API.
- Advantage of this design is that can scale to large size of our project grow up.
- Disavantage the complexcity when implement is higher than monolothich application.

1. Anotation to define this java class will be a controller. So that client can request to this class method if do the request mapping.
2. Define Swagger docs, using @ApiOperation and @ApiResponses to declare the information about the. If you start serser then you can see the swagger docs at [SWAGGER_UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) (note that start your local server before you click on this link, Start server by run Application.java)
3. Define and do mapping: Using anotation @RequestMapping mean that you tell spring that hey Spring I declarce a url that can do some thine awesome please expose it to client can access to it. For example:

   ```
   @RequestMapping(value = "/test", method = RequestMethod.GET, produces = "application/json")
   ```

   This will map the /test path to current running web app with method GET and return type is application/json. You can test it by run postman via this link : http://localhost:9090/users/test
